## Advice
* Don’t reinvent the wheel; use libraries
* When you have a choice, prefer the standard library over other libraries
* Do not think that the standard library is ideal for everything
* If you don’t use modules, remember to `#include` the appropriate headers.
* Remember that standard library facilities are defined in namespace std;
* when using `ranges`, remember to explicitly qualify algorithm names
* Prefer `import`ing `module`s over `#include`ing header files.
