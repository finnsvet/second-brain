In c++; all a function needs to run in a file (as long as its been compiled), no matter where called, is it's declaration.

An example:
  if a print function was declared in print.cpp, and we need it in main.cpp
  all we need to to write the declaration of the print function in print.cpp in main.cpp
  and call it. (As long as print.cpp has been compiled)

  This folder implements this example.
